Control devices from anywhere using a Raspberry Pi, [radio frequency-controlled outlets](https://www.amazon.com/Etekcity-Wireless-Electrical-Household-Appliances/dp/B00DQELHBS), and a [433MHz receiver/transmitter](https://www.amazon.com/SMAKNÂ®-433Mhz-Transmitter-Receiver-Arduino/dp/B00M2CUALS)

Excellent setup guide by [Sam Kear](https://www.samkear.com/hardware/control-power-outlets-wirelessly-raspberry-pi)  

Additions
- Web UI redesign
- Simple authentication via token strings (SSL is a must!)
- Supports IFTTT triggers
- Supports Amazon Alexa control (via IFTTT)
- Supports Apple Siri control (via [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge))
- Saves outlet state information across devices/platforms
- iOS web clip optimization

Notes:

//1
Be sure to include a *auth.php* file which contains your authorization tokens, similar to the following. The character strings should contain  

<?php
$tokens = array(
	"abcdefghij", //IFTTT
	"klmnopqrst", //iOS
	"uvwxyz1234", //Web
);
?>

//2
The *codesend* executable requires ample permissions to run. If you run into issues, use the following (per Sam Kear). Similarly, the *outletState.json* file needs to be writable:

- sudo chown root.root codesend
- sudo chmod 4755 codesend
- sudo chmod 4777 outletState.json
